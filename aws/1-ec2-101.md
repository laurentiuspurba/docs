# What is EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

## Options
* *On Demand* - allows you to pay fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
* *Reserved* - provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 Year or 3 Year Terms
* *Sport* - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
* *Dedicated hosts* - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. This can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use existing server-bound software licenses.
