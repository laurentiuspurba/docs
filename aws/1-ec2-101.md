# What is EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

You pay only for capacity you actually use.

## Options
* *On Demand* - allows you to pay fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
* *Reserved* - provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 Year or 3 Year Terms
* *Spot* - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
* *Dedicated hosts* - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. This can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use existing server-bound software licenses.

### On Demand ###
* Perfect for users that want the low cost flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
* Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
* Applications being developed or tested in Amazon EC2 for the first time

### Reserved ###
* Applications with steady state or predictable usage
* Applications that require reserved capacity
* Users can make up-front payment to reduce their total computing costs even further
  * Standard RIs (Up to 75% off on-demand)
  * Convertible RIs (Up to 45% off on-demand) feature the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
  * Scheduled RIs are available to launch within the time window you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, week, or a month.
  
 ### Spot ###
 * Applications that have flexible start and end times
 * Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices (gnome field, pharmaceutical, chemical company)
 * Users with an urgent need for large amount of additional computing capacity
 
  ### Dedicated hosts ###
  * Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multitenant
  * Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
  * Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly)
  * Can be purchased as a reservation up to 70% off the On-Demand price

How I remember them in 2017:
* **D** Density
* **R** RAM
* **M** - main choice for general purpose
* **C** Compute
* **G** Graphic
* **I** IOPS
* **F** FPGA
* **T** cheap general purpose (think T2 Micro)
* **P** Graphics (thin Pics)
* **X** Extreme Memory
