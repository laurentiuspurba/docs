## IAM (Identity Access Management) roles with EC2 ##

* Using user's credentials is not all that safe, especially if you are connecting from outside AWS ecosystem. Hence, comes **Roles**.
* Role is created globally, not per region or anything.
* It is possible to attach or replace IAM role to running EC2 instance
