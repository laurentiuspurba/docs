## EBS ##

**What is EBS - Elastic Block Storage?**
Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where that automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

It is basically, a disk in the cloud that you attach it to EC2 instances.

EBS volume that is attached to EC2 instances where Windows or linux is installed is called **root device volume**. Then you can volume on top of that.

### EBS Volume Types ###
* General Purpose SSD (GP2)
  * General purpose, balances both price and performance
  * Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB *with up to 10,000* IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volume at 3334 GiB and above
* Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
  * For very high performance application
  * Designed for I/O intensive application such as large relational or NoSQL databases
  * Use if you need *more than 10,000 IOPS*
  * Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume
* Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
  * Big data
  * Data warehouse
  * Log processing
  * Cannot be a boot volume
* Cold HDD (SC1)
  * Lowest Cost Storage for infrequently accessed workloads
  * File Server
  * Cannot be a boot volume
* Magnetic (Standard)
  * Lowesct cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types that is bootable. Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important
