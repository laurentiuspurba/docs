## Security Group ##

* Security Group is basically a virtual firewall that controls traffic to your instances.
* One instance can have multiple security groups

### Labs ###
* Security Group is statefull
* By adding Inbound rule it's automatically added Outbound rule
* Everything is blocked by default, so it is your responsibility to add the rules

### Recap ###
* All Inbound traffic is blocked by default
* All Outbound traffic is allowed
* Changes to Security Group take effect immediately
* You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
* You can have multiple Security Groups attached to EC2 instance
* Security Groups are **STATEFUL**
  * If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again
* You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control List (**STATELESS**)
* You can specfify allow rules, but not deny rules (by default nothing is allowed)
