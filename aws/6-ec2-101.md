## EBS Volume ##

* EC2 instance and EBS volume have to be in the same Availability Zone
* You have the ability to modify the volume, except the Magnetic type of volume
  * This can be done on the fly
  * You might experience performance distruption
* If you want to create different EBS volume from existing one that resides in, let say us-east-1b, do the following:
  * First is to create snapshot from existing EBS volume
  * Once the snapshot is ready, go to 'Snapshot' menu, and there few options that you can do, for example *Create Volume*
  * From *Create Volume* menu, you can select different Availability Zone
  * From *Copy* menu, it allows you to copy to another *Region*
  
### Exam Tips ###
#### Volume and Snapshots ####
* Volumes exist on EBS
  * Virtual Hard Disk
* Snapsjpts exist in S3
  * You won't see in S3. There is visibility if you go to S3 trying to find your snapshot
* Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes
* Snapshots are incremental - this means that only blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3
* For first snaphost, it may take some time to create

#### Snapshots of Root Device Volumes ####
* To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking snapshot
* However you can take a snapshot while the instance is running
* You can create AMI(Amazon Machine Images)'s from EBS-backed instances and snapshots
* You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and storage type
* Volume will **ALWAYS** be in the same Availablity Zone as the EC2 instance
* To move an EC2 volume from one AZ/Region to another, take a snap or an image of it, then copy it to new AZ/Region

#### Snapshots and Volumes Security ####
* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
* Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
* You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted
  * These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
