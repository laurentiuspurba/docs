## Creating Windows EC2 instance and RAID group ##

### RAID, Volumes & Snapshots ###
* RAID = Redundant Array of Independent Disks
  * RAID 0 - Striped, No Redundancy, Good Performance
  * RAID 1 - Mirrored, Redundancy
  * RAID 5 - Good for reads, bad for writes, AWS does not recommend ever putting RAID 5's on EBS
  * RAID 10 - Striped & Mirrored, Good Redundancy, Good Performance
  
When you will use RAID? It is when you are not getting the disk IO that you require.
