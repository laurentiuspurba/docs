## Creating Windows EC2 instance and RAID group ##

### RAID, Volumes & Snapshots ###
* RAID = Redundant Array of Independent Disks
  * RAID 0 - Striped, No Redundancy, Good Performance
  * RAID 1 - Mirrored, Redundancy
  * RAID 5 - Good for reads, bad for writes, AWS does not recommend ever putting RAID 5's on EBS
  * RAID 10 - Striped & Mirrored, Good Redundancy, Good Performance
  
When you will use RAID? It is when you are not getting the disk IO that you require.

How can I take a snaphost of a RAID Array?
* Problem - Take a snapshot, the snapshot excludes data held in the cache by applications and the OS. This tends not to matter on a single volume, however using multiple volumes in a RAID array, this can be a problem due to interdependencies of the array
* Solution - Take an application consistent snapshot
  * Stop the application from writing to disk
  * Flush all caches to disk
  * How can we do the above
    * Freeze the file system
    * Unmount the RAID array
    * Shutting down the associated EC2 instance
