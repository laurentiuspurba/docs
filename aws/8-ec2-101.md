## Encrypted Root Device Volumes & Snapshots ##

* To create a snapshot for Amazone EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot
* [Security] Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
* Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
* You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted
  * These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
