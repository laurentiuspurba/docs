## AMI Types ##
(EBS vs Instance Store)

You can select your AMI based on:
* Region (see Regions and Availability Zones)
* Operating System
* Architecture (32 or 64-bit)
* Launch permissions
* Storage for Root Device (Root Device Volume)
  * Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)
  * EBS Backed Volumes
  
### Summarize EBS vs Instance Store ###
* All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by instance store
* For EBS Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot
* For Instance Store Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created a template store in Amazon S3
* EC2 instance with Instance store - You can only reboot or terminate
* EC2 instance with EBS Volume - You can stop, and other operations on the instance

### Exam Tips ###
* Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called **Ephemeral Storage**
* Instance Store Volumes can**NOT be stopped**. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data
* EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped
* You can reboot both, you will not lose your data
* By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
