# S3 Transfer Acceleration

## What is S3 Transfer Acceleration
S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your uploads to S3. Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3. You will get distinct URL to upload to:
acloudguru.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
