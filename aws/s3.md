# S3-101

## What is S3?
Simple Storage Service that provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.
It is Object based storage, and the data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
It is a simple key-value store

## Characteristic
* Object based storage
* File size can be up to 5TB
* Unlimited storage
* Files are stored in Buckets
* S3 is a universal namespace, names must be unique globally
* When bucket is created, it's assigned DNS address; https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.conm/helloworld
* When file is uploaded to S3, the response will be 200 code for successful transaction

## Data Consistency Model
* Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
* Eventual consistency for write PUTS and DELETES (take times to propagate
* Update is atomic

## Key-Value store
* Key - name of the object
* Value - data that is made up of sequence of bytes
* Version ID - for versioning
* Metadata - data about data that is stored
* Subresources exists underneath an object, consists of:
  * Access Control Lists
  * Torrent - Bit torrent protocol
  
## The Basics:
* Built for 99.99% availability for S3 platform
* Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability
* Amazon Guarantee 11 x 9's in 99.99...% durability for S3 information
* Tiered Storage options
* Lifecycle management
* Versioning
* Encryption
* Secure your data using ACL and Bucket Policies

## Tiered Storage
* S3 - 11 x 9's in 99.99...% durability, stored redudantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurently
* S3 -IA (Infrequently Access) - less frequent access but requries rapid access if needed. Lower fee, plus rertrieval fee.
* RRS - Reduced Redundancy Storage - designed to provide 99.99% durability and availability of objects over a given year. (Use case - thumbnail files) - New product name is S3 One Zone - IA
* Glacier - very cheap, but used for archival only. It takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier.

## Charges
* Storage
* Requests
* Storage Management Pricing
* Data Transfer Pricing
* Transfer Acceleration

## Exam tips
* S3 is object based, i.e. allows you to upload files
* Can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
* Unlimited storage
* Files are stored in buckets a.k.a folders
* It is a universal namespace, that is, names must be unique globally
* Link: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.conm/helloworld
* Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
* Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
* Storage classes:
  * S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
  * S3 - IA (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
  * S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage (data is ezly to reproducible, such as thumb nails etc) a.k.a S3 One Zone
  * Glacier - Archived data, wait 3-5 hours before accessing
* Core fundamentals:
  * Key (name)
  * Value (data)
  * Version ID
  * Metadata
  * Subresources:
    * ACL
    * Torrent
  * Object storage only (for files)
  * *Not Suitable to install an operating system on*
  * Successful uploads returns HTTP 200
  
  ## Achtung
  * Read S3 FAQ
  
  ## Another Exam Tips
  * Buckets are universal name space
  * Upload an object to S3 receive a HTTP 200 Code
  * Types: S3, S3 - IA (Infrequent Access), S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (a.k.a S3 One Zone)
  * Encryption:
    * Client Side Encryption
    * Server Side Encryption
    * Server Side Encryption with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
    * Server Side Encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS)
    * Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
  * Control access to bucket using either a bucket ACL or using Bucket Policies
  * BY DEFAULT BUCKETS ARE PRIVATE AND ALL OBJECTS STORED INSIDE THEM ARE PRIVATE

## S3 - Versioning Examp Tips
* Once you enable versioning, you cannot disable it, but you can suspend it.
* MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) Delete (FAQ - Search S3 versioning on google) - to protect people for deleting file by mistake, we use MFA Delete
* Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
* Great backup tool
* Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
* Integrates with Lifecycle rules
* Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-facto authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security

## Cross Region Replication
* When creating a replication rule, only new objects will be replicated, while this is not the case for existing objects
  * Manually issue a CLI command: aws s3 cp s3://YOUR_SOURCE_BUCKET s3://YOUR_TARGET_BUCKET
  * By default, aws s3 cp command does not preserve permission on the target bucket (It will be private)
  * Some actions, ie. delete, won't be replicated in TARGET_BUCKET. Make sure you pay attention on it.

## Cross Region Replication Exam Tips:
* Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination bucket
* Regions must be unique
* Files in existing bucket are not replicated automitaclly. All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically
* You cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining  (at this time)
* Delete markers are replicated
* Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated
* Understand what Cross Region Replication is at a high level

## Lifecycle Management in IA S3 and Glacier
* Can be used in conjunction with versioning. You can turn it on or off
* Can be applied to current and previous versions
* Following actions can be done:
  * Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access Storage Claass (The obect must be 128K in size, and must be 30 days after the creation date)
  * Archive to Glacier Storage Class (30 days after IA, if relevant
  * Permanently delete

## Misc
* If you want to create a static website using S3, make sure to have a bucket name the same with domain name in order for route53 to work with S3
* Example of static website domain name: http://myacloudgurutests3website.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (Exam question)
