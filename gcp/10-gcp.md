# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container cluster orchestration system.

Kubernetes:
* Automates deployment, scaling, and operatins for container clusters
* Open source
* Built for a multi-cloud world
* **Pod** is a group of containers that are deployed together, with guaranteed network access
* Helps developers build modularly
* Eases application management
* Workload portability
* Persistent storage
* Rolling updates which incrementally replaces existing pods with new ones

Kubernetes makes application more elastic

## Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes cluster is a group of machines where kubernetes can schedule containers. Those machines are called nodes.

Kubernetes:
* Multi-zone clusters
* Load balancing
* Autoscaling

## Kubernetes Engine

Kubernetes engine lets you build, manage, resize, and delete kubernetes clusters.

These resources are none other than compute engines.

Kubernetes engine:
* Fully managed system for running containers
* Uses Compute Engine instances and resources
* You declare your desired application configuration, Kubernetes Engine implements and manages them.

Why people use Kubernetes Engine:
* Managed service, decouples operational, development concerns
* Built-in logging, health management, monitoring
* Easily update Kubernetes versions as they released
