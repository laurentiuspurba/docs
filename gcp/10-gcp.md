Kubernetes is a container cluster orchestration system.

Kubernetes:
* Automates deployment, scaling, and operatins for container clusters
* Open source
* Built for a multi-cloud world
* **Pod** is a group of containers that are deployed together, with guaranteed network access
* Helps developers build modularly
* Eases application management
* Workload portability
* Persistent storage
* Rolling updates which incrementally replaces existing pods with new ones

Kubernetes makes application more elastic
