# GCP Fundamentals

## Core Infrastructure

Projects are the main way you organize resources you use in GCP. Use them to group together related resources, usually because they have common business objectives.

There are 4 ways to interact with GCP management layers:
* Cloud Platform Console - Web user interface
* Cloud Shell and Cloud SDK - Command-line interface
* Cloud Console Mobile App - For IOS and Android
* REST-based API - For custom applications
