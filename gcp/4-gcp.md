## Cloud Storage

Object storage:
* is not the same as file storage in which you manage your data as hierarchy of folders.
* is not the same as block storage in which your operating system manages your data as chunck of disks
* means you save your storage here; the storage addresses us with unique key. Often these unique keys are in the form of URLs which means object storage interacts nicely with web technologies

**Cloud Storage** works just lik object storage plus it is fully managed, scalable service. That means you don't need to provision capacity ahead of time.
